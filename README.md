## Predicting-and-comparing-student-performance-in-online-and-offline-mode
### The objective of this study is to evaluate and predict student performance in online mode and compare it to performance in offline mode to determine their learning potential.
### As part of our project, we used a manually collected dataset to perform the appropriate operations.As a result, this dataset contains almost 170 entries that are used for evaluating and predicting academic performance of students. 
### > The first step in the process is to clean data and preprocess it to eliminate imperfections. 
### > Next, we explore the data to find patterns that link each attribute together.
### > The final step is to feed the data into machine learning models so that we can get a decent fit and an accurate prediction.
